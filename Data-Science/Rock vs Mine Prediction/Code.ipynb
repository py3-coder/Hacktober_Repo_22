# the no of mines and rocks examples datasets is almost equal hence we can get a good accuracy or a good model
#more the data , more better the model is

#stratify = this divides our data evenly , means in test data we have around equal no of M and R 
# random state = data is splitted in a specific way we can use random_state = 2 as well
